# Contract Advisor RAG: Towards Building A High-Precision Legal Expert LLM APP
***

### Project Overview
Lizzy AI, an Israeli startup at the forefront of contract AI, aims to revolutionize the legal landscape by creating the world's first fully autonomous contract lawyer. Leveraging cutting-edge Hybrid LLM technology, we're initially developing a powerful contract assistant capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts with no human intervention.
We are tasked to  build , evaluate and improve a RAG system for Contract Q&A that is added in Ms-word having a chat experience that answers anything about the contract and related legal matter. In other words, we are going to build an AI powered legal assistant that is easily accessible.
The RAG offers more contextual documents and more accuracy for generation. It is also cost-efficient than to attempt a full document prompting. 
So given a Knowledge base and an evaluation dataset for this project,  the RAG system will be tested and evaluated several times to check its robustness and performance metrics. For this we will be playing around with the chunking methods, embeddings and retrievals to make the best Legal Expert LLM RAG.

### Project Guide
Starting off, A fully functioning RAG pipeline was set up that can do a series of tasks such as retrieve and generate an answer for a given query based on a certain Knowledge base. Also this was checked and evaluated using the LLM-in this case OpenAI- to see if it has brought out the desired outputs. 
Once we get this fully functional RAG Pipeline, experiments will be further conducted on how we can make this system efficient and better than ever. 

- Tweaking some parameters, trying out different chunking strategies and also different embedders and Vector databases to evaluate the performance of each strategy. The final output will be a rigorous RAG that will be the best legal advisor for its fellow lawyer.
